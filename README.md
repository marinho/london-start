This is a command-line tool to create projects on London Web Framework in a very easy way, different scripts and templates,
from a package in repository, directory, zip file or URL. Usually those packages have tutorials following them, to help
the new user to understand what's happening behind the scenes.

Using this tool, it is possible to create a new project in a very new computer, including only Python and database runnning.

To start using **london-start**, just run the following command in your Terminal/Console window:

    $ curl http://londonframework.org/install.sh | sh

That will install **pip** and **virtualenv**, tools needed to create a new environment, and will install the executable
command **london-start.py**.

After that, you can start to use it, for example:

    $ cd MyProjects/
    $ london-start.py basic
