Installing
==========

LondonStart is very easy to be installed. Follow one of the ways below:

Option 1. Running installer script via curl
-------------------------------------------

The easiest way to install LondonStart is calling a URL via curl, like this::

    $ curl -s http://londonframework.org/install.sh | sh

That needs only Python installed to work. Pip will be installed if not found in current environment.

Option 2. Installing via pip
----------------------------

You can also install it using **pip** or **easy_install**, like below::

    $ pip install london-start

or::

    $ easy_install london-start

That is very similar to the option 1, but needs pip or easy_install to work.

Option 3. Installing development version from repository
--------------------------------------------------------

Finally you can clone our development version from Github and install it::

    $ git clone git://github.com/london-framework/london-start.git
    $ cd london-start
    $ sudo python setup.py install
