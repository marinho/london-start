Backward Incompatible Changes
=============================

This section exists to keep users informed about things that have been deprecated in favour of design improvements.

Since LondonStart was refactored as a separated tool, no changes were made to make it incompatible with previous versions.
However, a previous version existed as part of the framework as the files **bin/london-start.py** and those in
**london/start/**.

The main difference between the old and the refactored versions is that the old worked as basic intallation script in
**bootstrap.py**'s class **LondonStart** was used by another script in order to install a basic project under London's
directives and then extended to additional functions (i.e. installing and using LondonCMS).

This version changed the way to work with packages, which are .zip files including their own installation script (using
that same class with few changes), its own project template, able to be downloaded by a repository in London's official
website.
