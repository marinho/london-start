Next Steps
==========

The current version already has our main goals for this tool, but certainly new needs will apear in the time being.

A few improvements can happen in future:

- Auto-update of LondonStart when called
- GUI version for MacOSX, Linux and Windows
- Hability to prepare database schema and fixture files
